# 🎵 NavaPlayer

**NavaPlayer** is a simple Android music player app I developed as part of my learning journey into Android development.

This project helped me explore and practice key Android concepts such as MVVM architecture, Room ORM, navigation, and background processing — all within the context of a real but non-commercial educational project.

> ℹ️ **Note:** This app uses a **Persian-language public API** for learning purposes only.  
It is not intended for production or commercial use.

## 📚 Notes

> This app was built purely for **educational purposes**.  
I'm currently transitioning from over a decade of experience in office automation system implementation to a career in Android development. NavaPlayer was one of the projects I created to sharpen my understanding of real-world app structure.
